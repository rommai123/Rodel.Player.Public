Architecture and design
Rodel.Player.Public is designed with modularity in mind. The architecture emphasizes separation of concerns so components can evolve independently. Key areas include:
- Core playback engine: Supports a variety of media formats and streaming protocols. It is designed to be extensible so new formats or codecs can be added.
- UI layer: Built with WinUI 3 to provide a fast, responsive, and accessible interface. The UI focuses on clarity, minimalism, and intuitive navigation.
- Backend integration: Connectors for Emby and Jellyfin help the player discover libraries, metadata, and playback options. The aim is to make media discovery seamless.
- Networking and storage access: SMB and WebDAV support enables access to network shares and remote storage. This makes it possible to play media from a server or NAS without extra steps.
- Platform considerations: The project uses modern Windows app patterns while keeping an eye on cross-platform compatibility where feasible.

User workflows
- Setup: Install the release on a Windows device, connect to local servers, and configure your media sources.
- Library management: Let the app scan your shared folders, detect new media, and fetch metadata from compatible servers.
- Playback: Choose a source or a server item, start playback, and control playback with a clean, minimal UI.
- Networking: Mount SMB/WebDAV shares as needed to access additional media locations. Use supported network protocols to access remote libraries.
- Customization: Change themes, layouts, and playback preferences to match your workflow and taste.
- Updates: Check the Releases page for new builds that include fixes and enhancements.

Installation and setup details
- Quick start: Download the latest release from the Releases page, run the installer, and follow on-screen prompts. The installation process should guide you through basic configuration steps such as selecting media sources and optional server connections.
- Configuration files: Some settings may be stored in local configuration files or app data folders. You can edit these if you need to tweak advanced options. Always back up important settings before making changes.
- Updating: When a new release is available, download the new asset from the same Releases page and run it to upgrade. The update flow is designed to preserve user preferences where possible.
- Troubleshooting basics: If playback stalls or metadata doesn't appear, verify that your media sources are accessible and that network shares are mounted correctly. Restarting the app or reloading the library can resolve common issues.
- Guest keys and authentication: If the app connects to servers that require authentication, use the credentials provided by your media server or service. The project supports standard authentication flows used by Emby and Jellyfin.

Networking and data access
- SMB shares: The app can browse and play media from SMB shares on your local network. Ensure the share is reachable from your device and that the necessary permissions are in place.
- WebDAV: WebDAV support allows access to remote folders over HTTP. This can be useful for accessing media hosted on servers that expose WebDAV endpoints.
- Local vs. remote playback: Local playback uses local media files, while remote playback can leverage server-side processing or streaming features if supported by your backend.

Customization and extensions
- UI themes: Adjust appearance to suit your environment. The UI supports light and dark modes and other theming options.
- Layouts: Customize how media information is presented, how controls appear, and where panels are located within the window.
- Plugins and extensions: Extend functionality with plugins that integrate with servers, add new metadata sources, or provide extra playback options.
- Keyboard and remote control: Configure shortcuts and remote control mappings for a smoother experience.

Security and privacy basics
- Data handling: The app stores settings locally on your device. Media playback data and configuration are kept on your machine unless you opt to sync or back up.
- Network access: If you enable network shares or server connections, ensure your network is secure. Use trusted servers and secure credentials.
